<p>Criss cross puzzle challenge is a fun and creative solution to testing students’ understanding of what they’ve learned in a less stressful, more collaborative environment. Each student is given a crossword puzzle per week/day/month and have the option to switch questions if needed. Students can also find clues to their puzzle by looking at the big display that projects the most updated version of the crossword puzzle, actively being filled by other students at the same time. Teachers are advised to keep the big display near (hallway) or in the classroom on a projector so that students not only interact on their phones but also on the big screen. Students, together, eventually fill up the entire crossword puzzle and at the same time can see where they stand on the rankings list of students in order of the time it took them to answer their respective questions. At the end, students and teachers are able to look at the completed crossword puzzle and be able to review learned material at one simple glance. If you were thinking of bringing tech into the classroom, criss cross puzzle challenge is the way to go!
